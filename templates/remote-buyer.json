I'm currently located out of state/country and am interested in purchasing without being able to visit in person.\n\nTo help me make an informed decision remotely, I would appreciate your assistance with:\n\n1. Virtual tour possibilities - Would you be able to provide a comprehensive video walkthrough of the property, including all rooms, storage areas, and outdoor spaces?\n2. Recent inspections - Are there any recent inspection reports available that detail the condition of the property systems (HVAC, roof, foundation, etc.)?\n3. Neighborhood insights - Could you provide firsthand information about the immediate area, such as noise levels, neighbor proximity, and general atmosphere?\n4. Digital documentation - What remote closing options are available? Can all paperwork be handled electronically?\n5. Local services - Can you recommend trusted local contractors, property managers, or service providers I might need after purchase?\n6. Additional photographs - Would it be possible to get photos from different times of day to understand lighting conditions?\n\nAs I'm making this significant decision from afar, any additional information that would help me understand the full picture would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you for your help,\n\n{{your_name}}\n{{your_phone}}\n{{your_email}}"
