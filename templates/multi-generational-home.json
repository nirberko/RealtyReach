  "content": "Dear {{agent_name}},\n\nI'm interested in the property at {{property_address}} I found on Zillow as a potential multi-generational home for my family.\n\nWe're looking for a space that can accommodate several generations comfortably under one roof while still providing privacy and independence. I'd appreciate more information about:\n\n1. Separate living areas - Are there separate entrances, kitchenettes, or in-law suites that could serve as independent living spaces?\n2. Accessibility features - What accommodations exist for aging family members (ground floor bedrooms, step-free entrances, accessible bathrooms)?\n3. Zoning regulations - Does local zoning allow for accessory dwelling units or any modifications we might need to make?\n4. Communal spaces - Are there areas large enough for family gatherings while still maintaining personal space?\n5. Utility considerations - How are utilities structured? Can they be separated if needed for different living areas?\n6. Parking availability - Is there sufficient parking for multiple drivers in the household?\n\nOur family includes members ranging from seniors to young children, so a space that can accommodate diverse needs while fostering togetherness is our priority.\n\nI look forward to potentially visiting this property to assess how it might meet our multi-generational living requirements.\n\nThank you,\n\n{{your_name}}\n{{your_phone}}\n{{your_email}}"
