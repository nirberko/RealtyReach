I noticed that it was previously under contract but has returned to the market, I'm curious about why the previous contract fell through - were there any inspection concerns or other factors?\n\nAlso, I would appreciate if you could share more pictures of both the interior and exterior of the home.\n\nThank you for your assistance. I look forward to your response.\n\nBest regards,\n{{your_name}}\n{{your_phone}}\n{{your_email}}"
