  "content": "Dear {{agent_name}},\n\nI recently discovered the property at {{property_address}} on Zillow and am very interested in learning more about its eco-friendly and sustainable features.\n\nAs a buyer who prioritizes environmental responsibility and energy efficiency, I'd like to inquire about the following aspects of this property:\n\n1. Energy efficiency - What is the energy rating/certification of the home? Are there any recent utility bills available to review?\n2. Sustainable materials - Were eco-friendly or recycled materials used in construction or recent renovations?\n3. Renewable energy - Are there solar panels, geothermal systems, or other renewable energy features installed?\n4. Water conservation - What water-saving fixtures or systems are in place (rainwater collection, water recycling, efficient irrigation)?\n5. Indoor air quality - What measures ensure healthy indoor air quality (ventilation systems, non-toxic materials)?\n6. Future upgradeability - Are there opportunities to enhance the property's sustainability features if they aren't already present?\n\nI'm also interested in any green certifications the property may have (LEED, Energy Star, etc.) and any tax incentives or rebates that might apply to this property.\n\nI look forward to potentially viewing this property and learning more about its sustainable features.\n\nThank you,\n\n{{your_name}}\n{{your_phone}}\n{{your_email}}"
